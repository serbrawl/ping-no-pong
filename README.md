# ping-no-pong
My new Python game, it was difficult to create.
Ping-no-pong is a multiplayer game.
Implemented in Python with using the PyGame library.
On the same computer, 2 players use different keys to control different platforms. Who missed the ball - loses.
You need to add your own platform pictures with the name "platform.png" and a ball with the name "ball.png".
